# IRLib2 A Library for Receiving, Decoding and Sending Infrared Signals Using Arduino.

IRLib2 is copyright 2017 by Chris Young. It it is a major rewrite of the original IRLib 1.x by Chris Young which in turn was based on IRremote by Ken Shirriff. See COPYRIGHT.txt for details.

This library is covered under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3. See LICENSE.txt for a copy of the license.

This somewhat stripped-down version has been customized for use with Circuit Playground Express. It contains only IRrecvPCI receiver class because that is the one we recommend for use with Circuit Playground Express. It is automatically configured to use the building IR input and output capabilities of this board.

The complete library is available on GitHub at https://github.com/cyborg5/IRLib2

In that archive see CHANGELOG.txt for recent changes. It also contains a detailed Users Manual consisting of a reference, several tutorials, and information on how to implement new protocols is available in .docx, .pdf and .epub formats in the IRLib2/manuals/ folder.

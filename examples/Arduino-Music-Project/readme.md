#Arduino Music Project

**Note: this project is dormant (guess what that means). I will not be actively adding anything to this project, but i will take pull requests and stuff. Who knows though, I might come back**

This project uses a nice header file called <code>pitches.h</code> from <http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/tone>. Make sure you include it for the code to work.
